473 Op Amp Notes

PWM to volume control

Use TCNT3

Roll off for RC 100x less than PWM fundamental frequency
R = 10K to 1M

--R--*--
     -
     C

Alarm output
TCNT1

Radio outputs at 75mV, compared to alarm output of 5v

Need to equalize and combine using Summer OpAmp

Rf should be ~10k, R1 will be bigger, R2 will be smaller

P = V^2 / R
We desire 100mW

Use DC coupling cap for alarm output from uC

Positive input to OpAmp goes to 2v5 with .1uF (ish) cap and 100k input resistor (look at rolloff)

.1uF cap on power rail for OpAmp

Audio systems typically use a "single point ground"
